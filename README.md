# davincibox

This project aims to provide a ready-to-go container with all of the needed dependencies to install and run DaVinci Resolve on Linux, based on information compiled by bluesabre in his [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/bluesabre/8814afece711b0ca49de34c41e50b296). Davincibox is primarily intended for users of image-based systems such as Fedora Atomic Desktops and Universal Blue images, but it can be used on any Linux distro that distrobox is available on.

## Disclaimers

### GPU Support

My own testing for davincibox has been with an AMD RX 6600XT GPU, an AMD RX 9070 GPU, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 125H (i.e. Intel Arc integrated graphics). Other users have contributed test results here: [#21](https://github.com/zelikos/davincibox/issues/21)

AMD GPUs use ROCm (AMD's official compute package). There have previously been stability issues with using ROCm, typically in Fusion, but otherwise most everything does work. Note that AMD's [official GPU support for ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon/en/latest/docs/compatibility/native_linux/native_linux_compatibility.html#gpu-support-matrix) is limited, and users of older AMD GPUs (such as the RX 500 series) may not have success with ROCm.

Intel GPUs use `intel-compute-runtime`. No issues have been found so far.

Previously, `rusticl` (via the `mesa-libOpenCL` package) was included as the default for AMD GPUs, but this was found to [break ROCm entirely](https://github.com/zelikos/davincibox/issues/173), and so is no longer included in `davincibox-opencl`.

I do not have an NVIDIA GPU at this time and **cannot** directly troubleshoot issues with using them. Support and troubleshooting for NVIDIA-related issues is very reliant on members of the community.

### DaVinci Resolve Studio

Davincibox has had limited testing with DaVinci Resolve Studio. Use at your own risk. See [#26](https://github.com/zelikos/davincibox/issues/26)

### Codecs

DaVinci Resolve on Linux, especially the free version, has [limited codec support](https://documents.blackmagicdesign.com/SupportNotes/DaVinci_Resolve_19_Supported_Codec_List.pdf?_v=1723705210000). Unless you can show that certain codecs are available when using DaVinci Resolve outside of davincibox, but not when using davincibox, **do not** report issues about missing codecs here.

## Requirements & GPU Information

You will need [Podman](https://podman.io/), as well as [`distrobox`](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) or [`toolbox`](https://github.com/containers/toolbox).

You will also need the latest release of DaVinci Resolve from [Blackmagic's website](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve).

If you're less comfortable in the CLI, I recommend using the `setup.sh` script from this repository to help simplify the setup process, but ultimately use of the CLI is a requirement.

**Important**: Ensure `lshw` is installed on your system, as `setup.sh` uses it to detect whether you are using an Nvidia GPU or not. This is pre-installed on Universal Blue images, but you may need to install it yourself on other Linux distributions.

### AMD

AMD uses ROCm, and should generally work out of the box on modern AMD GPUs (RX 5000 series and above). However, some distros such as Debian may additionally require the `rocm-podman-support` package to be installed (on the host, not in davincibox).

[GPU support in ROCm is very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-gpus) and it may not work on older AMD GPUs (RX 500 series and prior). If the standard setup instructions do not result in a functional DaVinci Resolve, you can instead try using `rusticl`:

  - Distrobox: `distrobox enter davincibox`
  - Toolbox: `toolbox enter davincibox`

Then, from inside davincibox:

```
sudo dnf install mesa-libOpenCL

# If you exclude the path below, run-davinci defaults to launching DaVinci Resolve.
# If you want to launch one of the other programs included with Resolve,
# use the path to its binary as shown below.
run-davinci -c /path/to/binary
```

If rusticl does work better for you and you would like to launch Resolve with rusticl via the desktop shortcut, you can adjust the `DaVinciResolve.desktop` file in `$HOME/.local/share/applications`.

Change the `Exec=` line as follows:

  - Distrobox: `Exec=distrobox-enter -n davincibox -- /usr/bin/run-davinci -c /opt/resolve/bin/resolve %u`
  - Toolbox: `Exec=/usr/bin/toolbox run -c davincibox /usr/bin/run-davinci -c /opt/resolve/bin/resolve %u`

You can do the same for the other programs that come with DaVinci Resolve, too; just add the `-c` flag after `/usr/bin/run-davinci`.

### Intel

For Intel GPUs, the `intel-compute-runtime` package is included and used by default.

If needed, `rusticl` can also be used via the same instructions in the AMD section above.

### NVIDIA

NVIDIA users will need to install the `nvidia-container-toolkit` on their host OS. If you are using a [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) image such as [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/), this will already be installed. Otherwise, see [NVIDIA's installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) for instructions for your distribution.

You may additionally need to add a SELinux policy to allow containers to use your GPU. See the "Adding the SELinux policy module" in this [guide](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-use-gpus-containers-bare-metal-rhel-8). Otherwise, you may get an "Unsupported GPU processing mode" error when launching Resolve.

## Setup

### CLI:

Open a terminal, then run `chmod +x /path/to/setup.sh`

Then, `/path/to/setup.sh /path/to/DaVinci_Resolve_versionnumber_Linux.run`

### GUI:

If you're more comfortable in a GUI:

If you're using GNOME, open Files and navigate to where you downloaded the script to. In the example below, the script is in the same folder that I extracted the DaVinci Resolve download to. I recommend you do the same for ease of use, as the rest of the instructions will assume you have done so.

![](screenshots/setup_01.webp)

Right-click, and select Properties.

![](screenshots/setup_02.webp)

Then, make sure "Executable as Program" is toggled on.

![](screenshots/setup_03.webp)

Right-click on an empty spot in the folder. You should see either "Open in Console" as in the screenshot, or "Open in Terminal." Either will be fine.

![](screenshots/setup_04.webp)

In the newly-opened terminal window, enter the command below. Replace 'version' with the version of DaVinci Resolve that you are installing (see screenshot for example):

```
./setup.sh ./DaVinci_Resolve_version_Linux.run
```

![](screenshots/setup_05.webp)

Then, follow any further prompts in the installation script.

### Manual

#### Setup Davincibox

First, get davincibox set up. There are two different builds of davincibox, depending on whether you use an NVIDIA GPU or not:

**NVIDIA Users**

Distrobox:

```
distrobox create -i ghcr.io/zelikos/davincibox:latest --additional-flags "--gpus all" -n davincibox
```

Toolbox:

```
toolbox create -i ghcr.io/zelikos/davincibox:latest -c davincibox
```

**Intel & AMD Users**

Distrobox:

```
distrobox create -i ghcr.io/zelikos/davincibox-opencl:latest -n davincibox
```

Toolbox:

```
toolbox create -i ghcr.io/zelikos/davincibox-opencl:latest -c davincibox
```

#### Install DaVinci Resolve

On the host, run `--appimage-extract` on your DaVinci Resolve installer

```
/path/to/DaVinci_Resolve_version_Linux.run --appimage-extract
```

Then, run `setup-davinci squashfs-root/AppRun distrobox/toolbox` from within the container

e.g.

Distrobox:

```
distrobox enter davincibox -- setup-davinci squashfs-root/AppRun distrobox
```

Toolbox:

```
toolbox run --container davincibox setup-davinci squashfs-root/AppRun toolbox
```

The suffix at the end is for the `add-davinci-launcher` script. If omitted, setup will still run, but adding the launcher to your application menu won't work.

You can still run `add-davinci-launcher` separately, as either `add-davinci-launcher distrobox` or `add-davinci-launcher toolbox`, depending on what you're using.

After installation completes, you can remove the `squashfs-root` directory.

After setup, run `sudo dnf update` in the container to ensure drivers are up to date:


Distrobox:

```
distrobox enter davincibox -- sudo dnf update
```

Toolbox:

```
toolbox run -c davincibox sudo dnf update
```

## Upgrading

Usually, you'll only need to update the packages in the container (i.e. driver updates), not the container image itself. In this case, simply run `sudo dnf update` in davincibox as shown above.

Otherwise, a full upgrade requires re-creating the davincibox container with the newest version of the image. This should only needed if there has been a new GitHub release for davincibox, as this may include changes to the `setup-davinci` or `add-davinci-launcher` scripts. **When reporting issues, a full upgrade should be performed first**.

If a new version of davincibox is available and you need to upgrade, you can do so manually or with `setup.sh`.

### `setup.sh`

Run `setup.sh upgrade`, then follow the installation steps above.

### Manual

First, run `podman image pull ghcr.io/zelikos/davincibox:latest`

Then, follow the Uninstallation section below and go through manual setup again.

## Uninstallation

Run `./setup.sh remove`, or

Distrobox:

```
# If you are upgrading, you can avoid this line
distrobox enter davincibox -- add-davinci-launcher remove

distrobox stop davincibox
distrobox rm davincibox
```

Toolbox:

```
# If you are upgrading, you can avoid this line
toolbox run --container davincibox add-davinci-launcher remove

podman container stop davincibox
toolbox rm davincibox
```

## Troubleshooting
### No Audio output
DaVinci Resolve uses ALSA. In `davincibox` this is supported via the `pipewire-alsa` plugin, which re-directs sound to pipewire.
This however requires that the host system provides a pipewire server. If your host-system uses some other sound server, this might not work.

You can either convert your host system to provide `pipewire` or change your `davincibox` instance to use any sound server you have running.

For example, if your host-system uses `pulseaudio`, you can change `davincibox` as follows:

```
> distrobox-enter -n davincibox
> sudo dnf remove pipewire-alsa
> sudo dnf install alsa-plugins-pulseaudio
```

### Resolve Studio crashes on "Checking Licences..."
If you're a user of DaVinci Resolve Studio and have a USB Licence key, some Linux distributions may require you to add a udev rule to enable access to communicate with the USB key from within the container.

An example udev rule is as follows:
```
# Place this file in /etc/udev/rules.d/
# Recommended file name: 90-davinci-usb.rules

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="096e", TAG+="uaccess"

# Allow access to toolbox / distrobox

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="096e", MODE="0664", GROUP="users"
```

### Dual GPU Systems

Davincibox ships with switcheroo-control for handling multi-GPU systems, primarily intended for prioritizing the dedicated GPU over the system's integrated GPU (both in laptops and applicable desktops). If you have a system with multiple dedicated GPUs, however, you may need to tell switcheroo-control which one to use by default.

Enter davincibox with:

  - Distrobox: `distrobox enter davincibox`
  - Toolbox: `toolbox enter davincibox`

Then, to list the GPUs switcheroo-control detects, run `list-gpus`; this is a wrapper for `switcherooctl list` that includes a needed environment variable for it to work in distrobox.

The output should look something like this:

```
Device: 0
  Name:        Intel Corporation Meteor Lake-P [Intel Arc Graphics]
  Default:     yes
  Environment: DRI_PRIME=pci-0000_00_02_0
```

Use the `Device: #` line to determine the index for the GPU you want switcherooctl to use, then,

`sudo sed -i "s,switcherooctl launch,switcherooctl launch -g #," /usr/bin/run-davinci`

replacing # with the appropriate number determined previously.
